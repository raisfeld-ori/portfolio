If you ask me what's the project that I'm the most proud of, it would probably be Ksed (at least, during the making of this article).
it's an awsome app that gives an OS-like feel, but unlike an OS, it saves (mostly) everything on RAM, and encryptes the entire fake file system
right before saving it, making it far more secure than a regular OS.

## Part 1: The Home directory.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Home{
    path: Vec<Directory>,
    current_dir: Directory,
}

pub static mut FS: Home = Home::new();
```

This may look simple at first, but there's actually a lot more to it.

First, the FS object. It looks like a normal static variable, but if it was, then the code wouldn't change.
so, it's a static mutable object, which is something very unique in rust. For now, there's no need  to explain it further,
but it it quickly becomes very complicated to handle static mutable objects.

the Home structure manages to file system completely, Other than having some basic dervitives,
it's just a path and a current directory.

Looking back at it, I probably could've done this better by adding more refrences and controlling, but it doesn't actually matter
Too much since the Directory file type is simply a recursive data structure with a bunch of strings.

## Part 2: The Directories.

Directories might be one of the only times where using a recursive data structure is actually easier than
using a normal data Structure. The directory struct works like this:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Directory{
    files: Vec<DirectoryItems>,
    name: String,
}
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum DirectoryItems{File(File),Directory(Directory)}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct File{
    name: String,
    location: PathBuf
}
```

The Directory structure is probably the simplest part of the code, which is an odd thing to say about a recursive data
structure, but in the current context, it makes sense.

I thought about making a simple Linked list, where I would simply have a vector of each data structure. However,
I decided to go for a single Enum based vector since it would make it easier to implement new Data structures.

About the File struct, I may have lied a bit, the fake file system does interact with the real file system,
however, it does it in a secure way where, where the file is only saved encrypted, eliminating the threat of
someone stealing your files away.

I did this by attempting to decrypt the file using an AES CBC decryption, and checking if the content is a string:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub fn authenticate_user(name: &str, password: &str) -> bool{
    let location = encode_config(aes_encrypt(name, password, name.as_bytes()), URL_SAFE);
    let location = dir().join(location);
    if !location.exists(){return false;}
    for entry in read_dir(location).unwrap(){
        if entry.is_err(){continue;}
        let entry = entry.unwrap();
        let entry_path = entry.path();
        let entry = decode_config(entry.file_name().to_bytes(), URL_SAFE);
        if entry.is_err() {continue;}
        let entry = aes_decrypt(name, password, &entry.unwrap());
        let entry = String::from_utf8(entry);
        if entry.is_err() {continue;}
        match entry.unwrap().as_str(){
            "auth" => {
                let mut auth_data = File::open(entry_path).unwrap();
                let mut buffer: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
                let result = auth_data.read_to_end(&mut buffer);
                if result.is_err() {return false;}
                return aes_try_decrypt(name, password, &buffer);
            }
            _ => {continue;}
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

when the name or password are incorrect, the decrypted file would simply make no sense, therefore there is
no threat of someone opening the files and reading them.

Of course, the are a lot more parts to Ksed, but this simple data structure is still one of the coolest parts of the
code for me. Because instead of using a pre-build database, I created my own structure that can scale fairly well
and is also more secure and easy to use compared to usual databases, which is why I like it so much.

Thanks for reading this!
